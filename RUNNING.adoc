=== Running the samples

First start up the observability stack (for demo purposes you can use the provided Grafana, Tempo & Loki stack) and wait for it to start.

[source,bash]
----
$ docker-compose up
----

* To access Prometheus go to http://localhost:9090/
* To access Grafana go to http://localhost:3000/ (Grafana credentials: admin:admin)

Next, run the server side application (this will block your current terminal window)

[source,bash]
----
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run -pl :server
----

Next, run the client side application (this will block your current terminal window)

[source,bash]
----
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run -pl :client
----

You should see log statements similar to these:

[source]
----
2022-10-04T15:04:55.345+02:00  INFO [client,93b7a150b7e293ef,93b7a150b7e293ef] 92556 --- [           main] com.example.client.ClientApplication     : Will send a request to the server
2022-10-04T15:04:55.385+02:00  INFO [client,93b7a150b7e293ef,93b7a150b7e293ef] 92556 --- [           main] com.example.client.ClientApplication     : Got response [foo]
----

Now, you can go to http://localhost:3000/[Grafana], go to dashboards, and you can click on the provided `Logs, Traces, Metrics` dashboard. There you can pick the trace id with value `93b7a150b7e293ef` to find all logs and traces from both applications that correspond to that trace id.
